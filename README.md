# X Buddy Extension

A Chrome browser extension that displays the location of X.com users next to their usernames in the timeline.

## Features

- Includes debug mode for console logging.

## Installation

1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`.
3. Enable "Developer mode" in the top right corner.
4. Click "Load unpacked" and select the folder containing this extension.
5. The extension should now be installed and active.

## Usage

- Browse the timeline on X.com (home, search, etc.).
- The exstension will automaticly handle fetching the users location and will populate it.
- Locations are cached to avoid repeated fetches.

## Options

- Right-click the extension icon and select "Options" to access settings.
- Enable "Debug Mode" to see console logs for troubleshooting.

There are more options planned. For now, I am just trying to get the code base stable.

## How it works

- The content script runs on your timeline.
- Uses background windows to fetch the information which is then passed back to the main window.
- The timeline updates and the results are stored for faster loading in the future.

## Notes

- The extension assumes the location is formatted as "Account based in; [location]" on the about page.
- If the location is not found, nothing happens.
- Absolutly no external hooks are allowed.
- I will try to maintain the plugin but if you want to help, send a PR! I would greatly appreciate it.

## Permissions

- `activeTab`: Allows the extension to access the current tab for content script injection.
- `storage`: For saving debug settings.

## ToDo's

- Add filtering or whitelist/blacklist.
- Add export so in the event that an update is ran, you can upload your list without building a new one.

## Compatibility

- Chromium-based browsers, but tested on Brave.
