# X Buddy Extension

A Chrome browser extension that displays the location of X.com users next to their usernames in the timeline.

## Features

-   Adds a location (if present) next to the authors name.
-   Import/Export
-   Statistics
-   No external communication. Just a standalone extension.

## Installation

1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`.
3. Enable "Developer mode" in the top right corner.
4. Click "Load unpacked" and select the folder containing this extension.
5. The extension should now be installed and active.

## Usage

-   Browse the timeline on X.com (home, search, etc.).
-   The extension will automatically handle fetching the users location and will populate it.
-   Locations are cached to avoid repeated fetches.

## Options

-   Right-click the extension icon and select "Options" to access settings.
-   Select how you want to fetch location. Theres Auto, Hover, and Button.
-   Export cached data.
-   Import and sync cached data from another machine.

There are more options planned. For now, I am just trying to get the code base stable.

## How it works

-   The content script runs on your timeline.
-   Uses background windows to fetch the information which is then passed back to the main window. It is also important to note that a new window will open to load the data and then will close.
-   The timeline updates and the results are stored for faster loading in the future.

## Notes

-   The extension assumes the location is formatted as "Account based in; [location]" on the about page.
-   If the location is not found, nothing happens.
-   Absolutely no external hooks are allowed.
-   I will try to maintain the plugin but if you want to help, send a PR! I would greatly appreciate it.

## Permissions

-   `activeTab`: Allows the extension to access the current tab for content script injection.
-   `storage`: For saving debug settings.
-   `tabs`: For finding loading location.
-   `scripting`: For ruining the logic and updating the location.

## ToDo's

-   Add filtering or whitelist/blacklist.
-   Add export so in the event that an update is ran, you can upload your list without building a new one.

## Compatibility

-   Chromium-based browsers, but tested on Brave.

## Credits

-   https://flagicons.lipis.dev/ - Flag assets are included.
